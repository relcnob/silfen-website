          <h1>Sustainability</h1>
          <p>
            Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
            behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
            little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young,
            global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not
            only for own sake, but for all future generations to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our
            carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious
            decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the
            countries, in which we operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”. We
            believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
            future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products
            in better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will
            start implementing more conscious initiatives within the company,
            and we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as
            we are all in this together!
          </p>
          <p>
            As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we
            have a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a production as
            possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower
            our carbon footprint even further.

            <h3>
              The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
              worldwide
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the biggest issues is the use and contamination of drinking
              water. We try to minimize the water consumption in our production
              in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment
              and to ensure local access to clean water.
            </p>
            <p>
              All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
              eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
              consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
              cotton, than conventional cotton products.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020 we introduced a new collection of bags made from a new
              material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This
              recycled material is primarily made from plastic waste collected
              from the oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from
              all over the world.

            <h3>
              We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have
              on our planet.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Because of this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly
              shipping options when applicable. We are in close contact with
              other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible –
              by joining forces.
            </p>
            <p>
              We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or
              train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of
              shipping, reducing polluting emissions.

            <h3>Our way</h3>
            <p>
              At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
              obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
              also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe
              that it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible
              conduct within our organization, including all our suppliers. We
              ensure the ethical development of future generations by
              guaranteeing that our suppliers do not support or make use of
              child labor. We encourage our factories to ensure that all
              families have the possibility to put their children in school.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees
              as well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
              employees, providing them with financial stability after
              retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
              We support the different religions of employees and protect their
              right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
              discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected
              from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow
              the issued principles regarding working conditions, quality,
              pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a
              SILFEN bag is always crafted in a responsible manner.
            </p>
            <p>All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>

              <h4>Cotton</h4>
              <p>
                Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly
                known as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from
                eco-friendly or organic cotton. Both materials require far less
                water consumption than conventional cotton products. Every nylon
                product is made from eco-friendly material, meaning that the
                journey from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts the environment
                as little as possible.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4>Leather</h4>
              <p>
                All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf
                leather and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that
                every part of the animal is utilized in various industries. We
                love colors and new trends, but we incorporate consciousness and
                quality in our design processes to retain timelessness in all
                products. All our components, zippers, thread, reinforcement,
                glue etc., are made from high-quality raw materials. We
                encourage our customers to take good care of their bag,
                prolonging the life of the product. By caring for your bag, you
                will be able to create more experiences with it – an important
                factor in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.

              <h4>Vegan</h4>
              <p>
                In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection,
                and we have continued to this since then. We make sure that all
                non-leather material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100%
                vegan, promising that these products do not contain any parts
                from animals.

              <h4>rPET Line</h4>
              <p>
                In 2020 we launched a new collection manufactured in rPET,
                recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well known
                as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles that
                often end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled
                material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
                oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over
                the world. With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the
                impact of pollution irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this
                awareness to our customers, and to encourage them to help clean
                our oceans!
